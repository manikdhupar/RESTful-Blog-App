A Blogsite that follows REST convention.

1) Nodejs and Mongodb should be installed.

2) For dependencies either look packet.json
                  OR
  IN TERMINAL: npm install express ejs body-parser mongoose method-override
  
3) Finally in terminal type: node app.js
    and you will get a message that server is running on port 3000.

SINCE this is a dynamic app ,at first you would have to enter the 'title','link' for image and 'description' of the blog and then our beautiful blogsite would work and store your input in the database.
